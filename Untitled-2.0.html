  <h1>About us</h1>
  <h2></center>Sligo Tropics was set up to replace the preivous Sligo basketball team. The team was promoted to division 1 after entering the league given our talent of players. Our plan is to build on the reputation on Sligo basketball and in the next two years, get promoted to the superleague level. </center></h2>

    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">The Tropics have an executive committee, made up of 14 members who work in the logistics of managing the arena, our teams and hundreds of matches that we have each year. Some of our sub-commitees include Fundraising, Devolopment, Transfer, Finance and Super League. Each team has a coach whose role is to focus on skill enhancement and to get the best possible result they can eah season.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="text_column">Each team also has a manager, their role is to schedule games, ensure players are registered and generally look after the team. The role is varied and supports the coach and the team. This maximises the team to focus on basketball and enjoy their time as a member of the Tropics.</p>
  <p class="text_column">Like all basketball clubs in Ireland, all of our advances have been made through the dedication of a few and the hard work of many. Maintaining a high standard of our facilities will require a lot of hard work in the future.</p><center
